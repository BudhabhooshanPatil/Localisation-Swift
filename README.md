# Localisation-Swift
App localisation is the adaptation of a product or service to meet the needs of a particular language, culture or desired population's "look-and-feel."

Expand the market for your app by supporting multiple languages and regions.

<p>

When you create new XCode project, XCode will automatically generate resources and the file structure including them for the default language.

## Adding New Localization

Ok, we have the Base language resource structure by default. Let’s add new language support.
Select your project file in Project Navigator, and select your project in the project and targets list. Open Info tab, and click “+” button under Localizations section. Then choose a language you want to support from the dropdown list shown.

## Localize string content
To localize strings, you will need to add your strings to the Localizable.strings file.

## Adding Key-Pair
Let’s add words and phrases used in the app to the Localizable.strings file of Base. And then press localize on right hand side to give alternate word in local language.
